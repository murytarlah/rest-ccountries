## My process

I started out by bootstrapping the project with `create-react-app` and then I created the necessary components and styles for the project. I then imlemented the logic for the theme switcher and the search functionality. I then added the data from the API and styled the components to match the design.

### Built with

-   React
-   CSS
-   Grid
-   Tailwind CSS

### What I learned

I got to learn how to use the `fetch` API to get data from an external API and how to use the `useState` hook to manage state in a functional component. I also got to learn how to use the `useEffect` hook to perform side effects in a functional component.

### Continued development

I plan to continue learning more about React and how to use it to build more complex applications. I also plan to write unit tests and integration tests for this very soon.

### Useful resources

-   [`React`](http://react.dev/) - This is a UI library for building user interfaces. It is very easy to learn and use.
-   [`React Router`](https://reactrouter.com/) - This is a routing library for React. It is very easy to use and has a lot of features.
-   [`Tailwind`](https://tailwindcss.com/) - This is a utility-first CSS framework. It is very easy to use and has a lot of features. It helped me in styling my components and making my styling time much faster.
